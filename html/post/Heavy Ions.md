### My work with Dr. Ron Belmont

We are currently working on a project for sPhenix, using
mathematical techniques to model heavy ion collisions at RHIC
(The relativistic Heavy Ion Collider).

I met Dr. Belmont here during both of our first semesters at UNCG. He
was begininning his new position as a researcher here at UNCG, and I was
a returning student entering the Physics and Astronomy Dept. I was
trying to learn how to use emacs for my project with Dr. Miroshnichenko,
and Dr. Belmont was around and is a master of emacs, so I requested his
help and he agreed, kicking off an awesome work relationship.

I realized that he was fairly available, and his research is very
interesting, so I asked to be in his research group, and he agreed.
We immediately kicked off with a giant C++ and ROOT project, in concert
with setting up my (insanely complicated) environment for Heavy Ions
research. We use several key software frameworks and tools, including
Pythia 8 and CERN's ROOT.</p>

All of our most current work is available for view on Github (insert link here),
and we hope to have a paper published at some point in the not-so-distant future.
